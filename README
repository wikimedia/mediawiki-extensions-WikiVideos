# WikiVideos

WikiVideos is based on an algorithm
that translates plain-text instructions
into videos.

Here's a simple example:

<wikivideo>
File:Sunset.jpg
The sun sets
File:Moonrise.jpg
and the moon rises.
</wikivideo>

Put in words, the wikivideos algorithm:

# Displays the first image while the first text is read (using Google's text-to-speech cloud service)
# Displays the second image while the second text is read

This simple idea can be extended in many ways. For example, here's a more elaborate wikivideo:

<wikivideo subtitles="yes">
File:Sunset.jpg
The sun sets
1
File:Moonrise.jpg
and the moon rises.
2
</wikivideo>

While this syntax has its limits, it also has many advantages:

* It's simple and allows anyone with a browser to create videos.
* Videos can be easily improved by others.
